To use the OpenAl API with Auto-GPT, we strongly recommend setting up billing (AKA paid account). Free accounts are limited to 3 API calls per minute, which can cause the application to crash.  You can set up a paid account at Manage account > Billing > Overview.  It's highly recommended that you keep track of your API costs on the Usage page. You can also set limits on how much you spend on the Usage limits page. = G platform.openai.com  GS Overview  ORGANIZATION     fb Personal © Settings  Usage  Members  Billing  Overview Payment methods Billing history Usage limits  Preferences  USER  API keys  Documentation  API reference Examples Playground  Billing overview  Free trial  You are currently on the free trial.

Make sure you have Docker installed, see requirements  2. Create a project directory for Auto-GPT  mkdir Auto-GPT  cd Auto-GPT  3. In the project directory, create a file called docker-compose.yml with the following contents: version: ""3.9"" services: auto-gpt:  image: significantgravitas/auto-gpt  depends_on: - redis  env_file: - .env  environment: MEMORY_BACKEND: ${MEMORY_BACKEND: -redis} REDIS_HOST: ${REDIS_ HOST: -redis}  profiles: [""exclude-from-up""]  volumes: - ./auto_gpt_workspace:/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace - ./data:/app/data ## allow auto-gpt to write logs to disk - ./logs:/app/logs ## uncomment following lines if you want to make use of these files ## you must have them existing in the same folder as this docker-compose.yml #- type: bind # source: ./azure.yaml # target: /app/azure.yaml #- type: bind # source: ./ai_settings.yaml # target: /app/ai_settings.yaml  redis:  image: ""redis/redis-stack-server: Latest""  4. Create the necessary configuration files. If needed, you can find templates in the repository. 5. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub  docker pull significantgravitas/auto-gpt  6. Continue to Run with Docker  Auto-GPT uses a browser in headless mode by default: | HEADLESS_BROWSER=True . Please do not  change this setting in combination with Docker, or Auto-GPT will crash. Set up with Git  Make sure you have Git installed for your OS.  To execute the given commands, open a CMD, Bash, or Powershell window. On Windows: press Win+X and pick Terminal, or Win+R and enter cmd  1. Clone the repository  git clone -b stable https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git  2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository  cd Auto-GPT  Set up without Git/Docker  We recommend to use Git or Docker, to make updating easier. Also note that some features such as Python execution will only work inside docker for security reasons.  1. Download source code (zip) from the latest stable release  2. Extract the zip-file into a folder  Configuration  1. Find the file named .env.template inthe main Auto-cpt folder. This file may be hidden by default in some operating systems due to the dot prefix. To reveal hidden files, follow the instructions for your specific operating system: Windows, macOS.  2. Create a copy of .env.template andcallit .env ; if you're already in a command prompt/terminal window: cp .env.template .env.  3. Open the .env file in a text editor.  4. Find the line that says oPENAI_API_KEY= .  5. After the = , enter your unique OpenAl API Key without any quotes or spaces.  6. Enter any other API keys or tokens for services you would like to use. To activate and adjust a setting, remove the # prefix.  7. Save and close the .env file.  If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set UsE_AZURE to True and make an Azure configuration file:  e Rename azure.yaml.template to azure.yaml and provide the relevant azure_api_base , azure_api_version and all the deployment IDs for the relevant models in the azure_model_map section:  o fast_11m_model_deployment_id : your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment ID © smart_1l1m_model_deployment_id : your gpt-4 deployment ID  © embedding_model_deployment_id : your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment ID  Example:  # Please specify all of these values as double-quoted strings # Replace string in angled brackets (<>) to your own deployment Name  azure_model_map:  fast_llm_model_deployment_id: ""<auto-gpt-deployment>""  Details can be found in the openai-python docs, and in the Azure OpenAl docs for the embedding model. If you're on Windows you may need to install an MSVC library.  Running Auto-GPT Run with Docker  Easiest is to use docker-compose .  Important: Docker Compose version 1.29.0 or later is required to use version 3.9 of the Compose file format. You can check the version of Docker Compose installed on your system by running the following command: docker-compose version  This will display the version of Docker Compose that is currently installed on your system.  If you need to upgrade Docker Compose to a newer version, you can follow the installation instructions in the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/  Once you have a recent version of docker-compose, run the commands below in your Auto-GPT folder.  1. Build the image. If you have pulled the image from Docker Hub, skip this step (NOTE: You will need to do this if you are modifying requirements.txt to add/remove depedencies like Python  libs/frameworks)  docker-compose build auto-gpt  2. Run Auto-GPT  docker-compose run --rm auto-gpt  By default, this will also start and attach a Redis memory backend. If you do not want this, comment or remove the depends: - redis and redis: sections from docker-compose.yml .  For related settings, see Memory > Redis setup.  You can pass extra arguments, e.g. running with --gpt3only and --continuous :  docker-compose run --rm auto-gpt --gpt3o0nly --continuous  If you dare, you can also build and run it with ""vanilla"" docker commands:  docker build -t auto-gpt . docker run -it --env-file=.env -v $PWD:/app auto-gpt docker run -it --env-file=.env -v $PWD:/app --rm auto-gpt --gpt3o0nly --continuous  Run with Dev Container  1. Install the Remote - Containers extension in VS Code. 2. Open command palette with Fi and type Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container . 3.Run ./run.sh. Run without Docker Create a Virtual Environment  Create a virtual environment to run in.  python -m venv venvAutoGPT source venvAutoGPT/bin/activate pip3 install --upgrade pip  Due to security reasons, certain features (like Python execution) will by default be disabled when running without docker. So, even if you want to run the program outside a docker container, you currently still need docker to actually run scripts.  Simply run the startup script in your terminal. This will install any necessary Python packages and launch Auto-GPT.  e On Linux/MacOS: ./run.sh e On Windows:  .\run. bat  If this gives errors, make sure you have a compatible Python version installed.
